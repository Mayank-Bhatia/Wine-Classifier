# Wine-Classifier
Using a random forest classifier to model wine quality with over 90% accuracy. 

Using UCI's wine quality dataset, found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

Two datasets are included, related to Portugal's red and white "Vinho Verde" wines. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

Attribute Information:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): <br>
1 - fixed acidity <br>
2 - volatile acidity <br>
3 - citric acid <br>
4 - residual sugar <br>
5 - chlorides <br>
6 - free sulfur dioxide <br>
7 - total sulfur dioxide <br>
8 - density <br>
9 - pH <br>
10 - sulphates <br>
11 - alcohol <br>
Output variable (based on sensory data): <br>
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
